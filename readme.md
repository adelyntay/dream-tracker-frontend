## Dream Journal
Project 4 built during my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly. 

Built using: MongoDB/Mongoose, Flask, React, Node

This is frontend repo for dream journal, containing all client-side code responsible for handling requests, processing data, and generating responses. 

Dream Journal enables users to record details about their dreams, including dream type and sleep quality. The app aims to help users identify any correlations between their sleep and dream experiences. 

Users can share their dreams with others and receive feedback/comment through the app's discussion page.

The backend code for this project is available in [this repository](https://github.com/adelyntay/dream-tracker-backend).
